  <p>DJs create mashups of songs all the time for their sets, and people generally can mash up a few songs together if they are in the same key, have the same BPM, and follow the same chord progression. However, it is much harder to do this automatically. If a computer were able to automatically mash two songs and make them sound good together, being a DJ would become much easier and people everywhere would be able to enjoy two of their favorite songs as one much more often.</p>
