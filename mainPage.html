  <h1>Welcome to DJ Frankenstein!</h1>
  <p>We are in the process of creating an automated mashup generator. The idea is that a user selects two songs in the same chord progression, and then they receive back an audio clip of the two songs’ choruses mashed up. An example of a mashup our system will generate is one song’s background and instrumentation with the other song’s vocals overlaid on top.</p>
